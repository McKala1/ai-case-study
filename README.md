##Cape Privacy Saving Data with Privacy-Preserving AI

## Overview and Origin

* The name of the company I chose to research is Cape Privacy.

* The company Cape Privacy was incorporated in 2018.

* The founders of the company are Ché Wijesinghe (CEO), Gavin Uhma, David Besemer, Ben Decoste, Mike Gardner and Alan Wong.

* The idea for Cape Privacy came about from the collaborative efforts of Ché Wijesinghe, and Gavin Uhma. Ché and Gavin needed to address the growing demand for privacy-preserving AI solutions in the scene of advancing data analytics. The idea was rooted in the need to unlock the value of sensitive data while still safeguarding privacy and complying with regulations. In an interview Gavin had with Reesha Dedhiathe, head of marketing at Cape Privacy he offered “an inspiring vision of what's possible when data–and individual privacy–is protected by default” (Cape Privacy, 2023). 

* In terms of funding Cape Privacy has secured a total of $20 million in ‘Series A’ funding from various investors (Miller, 2021). In the beginning, it was a small start up with just a few employees, from there it rocket launched into the brand size it is today. Some examples of investors include Version One Ventures, Haystack, Tom Noonan, Spearhead, and many more (Crunchbase, 2021). This is allowing Cape Privacy to develop and market their innovative privacy-preserving AI technology (Cape Privacy, 2023). 

## Business Activities

* Cape Privacy is trying to solve the challenge of allowing the use of advanced data analysis and machine learning on sensitive data without compromising its data privacy. Their mission is to smooth the path for secure utilization of private data for valuable insights. It should be something that automatically comes along in dealing with private data to make our lives easier. With the use of Cape Privacy’s technology all data in a company can be secured from leaks and hackers. This is a major security measure that will benefit everyone both now, and in the future to come. 

* Cape Privacy's primary customers include organizations and enterprises that handle sensitive data, such as financial institutions, healthcare providers, and e-commerce platforms. These industries collectively represent a massive market size due to their need to protect and leverage large amounts of private data. The healthcare industry alone has grown “from $7,499.75 billion in 2022 to $7,975.87 billion in 2023 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.3%” (The Business Research Company, 2023). The financial industry has grown from “from $25,848.74 billion in 2022 to $28,115.02 billion in 2023 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.8%” (The Business Research Company, 2023). The e-commerce market size is the most impressive, reaching $16.6 Trillion US dollars in 2022 , with an expectation to reach $70.9 Trillion by 2028, “exhibiting a CAGR of 27.38% during 2022-2028” (IMARC Group, 2023). These are huge industries dealing with insanely large amounts of people's sensitive data that must be protected at all costs. The more technology advances the more sensitive data will flood these industries.   

* Cape Privacy offers a groundbreaking privacy-preserving AI platform that employs advanced cryptographic techniques like homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation. Their platform enables organizations to analyze and train machine learning models on encrypted data without ever decrypting it, ensuring data privacy and regulatory compliance. This unique solution sets Cape Privacy apart from their competitors (Cape Privacy, 2023). Nothing like this has been done in the industry before, and marketed for other companies to use. Cape Privacy is offering a service that benefits everyone and can be used in any industry. An unfair advantage that this company also has is the amount of funders supporting them. This makes a huge difference because now the company can afford to expand, and hire quality employees. CEO Ché Wijesinghe states in a video put on by Cybercrime Magazine “Having financial backing to make the right hires in a very competitive job market has been key to building a world class team” (YouTube, 2022). 

* Cape Privacy implements cutting-edge cryptographic technologies, including homomorphic encryption, secure enclaves, and differential privacy. These technologies allow them to safeguard sensitive data while facilitating advanced data analysis and machine learning (Cape Privacy, 2023). In a nutshell Cape Privacy allows you to type in sensitive information with it being safe and protected the entire time. Some Cape Privacy integrations are Python and JavaScript (StackShare, 2023). These are great integrations because they are very commonly used by coders behind almost every business .

## Landscape

* Cape Privacy operates at the intersection of AI, in fields such as data privacy, data security, machine learning and software engineering (Cape Privacy, 2023). They would be considered in the technology field because of the use of these modern tech savvy skills. However, the service the company offers can be used in any field. 

* Over the past decade, the field has witnessed a significant trend toward the increased adoption of AI and machine learning across basically every industry. At the same time, data privacy and security have taken center stage. Innovations in homomorphic encryption, secure enclaves, and federated learning have been critical in this space. With consumers getting more comfortable shopping, and filling out forms online the need for private information to be secure is a must. 

* Cape Privacy faces competition from established companies like Microsoft, IBM, and Palantir Technologies in the field of privacy-preserving AI and data security (Cape Privacy, 2023). These are all well established, large companies. For example, Microsoft is 48 years old, they were established back in 1975 on April 4th. Companies as old as these have a more established consumer base, and have trust from people just because of brand recognition. This is what Cape Privacy will have to deal with, and unfortunately only literal time can enhance this for them. 

## Results

* Cape Privacy has made a substantial impact by empowering organizations in the medical, financial, and e-commerce field to gain insights from sensitive data securely. Their privacy-preserving AI platform has been used by numerous companies in different industries. They are leading to improved data privacy, compliance with ethics and regulations, and more accurate data-driven insights day by day. They have helped many businesses save their data from being breached by unethical people. 

* Key metrics in this field include the reduction in data breaches, enhanced data analytics efficiency, and compliance with privacy regulations. Cape Privacy has demonstrated a notable decrease in data breaches and enhanced data analytics efficiency for their clients. While the metrics on this are still to be published, it is the small day by day protection that matters most, and this is immeasurable on an emotional, ethical standpoint. 

* Cape Privacy has positioned itself as a strong contender in the privacy-preserving AI market by delivering a complete platform that applies various cryptographic techniques. Their success has positioned them as an intimidating competitor in this evolving field (Cape Privacy, 2023). Cape Privacy offers more products, better customer service, and feasible financing compared to competitors like Evervault, and Anjuna (CB Insights. (n.d). 

## Recommendations

* If I were to advise the company to offer a product or service I would recommend Cape Privacy consider offering a privacy-preserving AI consulting service to help organizations adopt their technology more effectively. This service can include human guidance on implementation, best practices, and custom solutions tailored to specific industries. The company website has a platform very similar to "Slack" called 'Discord' which is a sort of instant message page. However I feel with the touch of human consulting it would be a much better way to help companies who might not be as 'tech savvy'. This will also appeal to both older, and younger generations because we all need the comforting touch of human interaction when implementing, and investing in something new. 

* Offering consulting services can expand their value proposition, engage with clients more closely, and address individual customer needs. It can also enhance trust and loyalty among clients. This would benefit the company in establishing a good consumer base, with human to human interaction. It will also help build consumer recognition with the more companies that use it. 

* The consulting service could leverage technologies such as blockchain for data transparency and traceability, as well as AI model explainability techniques. These technologies can further enhance data privacy and the interpretability of AI models, setting Cape Privacy apart in the market (Cape Privacy, 2023). This addition of consulting would utilize actual human beings. This is also great for opening up more job opportunities with the company which will also help spread brand recognition. 

* AI consulting is an appropriate solution because by combining AI, blockchain, and consulting services this can build solutions. These solutions will not only leverage the power of artificial intelligence but also enhance transparency, data integrity, and traceability. These are increasingly important in various industries, including healthcare, supply chain, finance, and more.
